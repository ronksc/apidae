						<p>From the very moment you leave the hospital carrying your precious little newborn, you may have the feeling that you can’t really believe that the baby is actually here! This very tiny, really fragile baby is going to sit behind you in the car and they’re coming home with you. </p>
						<p><strong>"Is this car seat in right? Did I buy the right kind? Is the belt too loose? Is he safe? Is he comfortable? Are we really prepared for this?”</strong></p>
						<p>These will be the first questions in your mind followed by about a million other questions throughout each day of new parenthood. Your daily routines will have forever changed. The days and months to come will be a steep learning curve filled with more worry and amazement than you have ever experienced. </p>
						<p>Each day brings new adventures and challenges. Being well-prepared to receive your newborn at home will make your first days at home together a little less overwhelming so that you can really savor those first powerful bonding moments. </p>

								<p>Yes, you are now solely responsible for another person's life – and with no baby manual it may seem incredibly intimidating.</p>

							<p>Once baby's umbilical cord stump has fallen off, she's ready for a bath in her baby tub. Surprisingly, choosing a bathtub and personal care products isn't always straightforward.</p>
							<p><strong>"Should the tub have a newborn support? Is the tub the right size for your baby? What are the procedures for bathtime? What should the water temperature be? Which personal care products are suitable and have less chemicals?”</strong></p>
							<p>The bath time routine is great for bonding as it provides a distraction-free routine to slow down and interact physically and emotionally with your baby. </p>

								<p>The time has come to venture out of your cozy nest for the first time with your precious little one. The days of leaving the apartment in 5 minutes flat, squeezing in a trip to the bank and dropping by the grocery store for a quick errand are long gone. Be realistic and practical – factor in time for packing all the essentials, feedings, placing baby in the car seat, stowing and reopening the stroller and diaper changes.</p>

							<p>Now that he can sit independently, leaving his hands free to explore, what will be the first thing he reaches for? After your baby accomplishes this milestone, crawling is right around the corner! Exciting times are ahead.</p>

									First Steps</h3>
								<p>They go from rolling over and sitting up, to crawling and standing all by themselves, and before you know it they’re actually taking their very first steps. You can’t believe your eyes. They’re really doing it! To see them actually take those first steps and then to gaze at their little face filled with awe and delight – what an experience!</p>
								<p>This marks the beginning of a new and exciting stage – baby’s new self-sufficiency and mobility will lead her to explore endlessly with constant movement and falling – so much falling. This is a good time to introduce the concept of limits. Teach your baby that freedom comes with boundaries. It will help protect them from dangerous objects and situations – ready or not, here they come!</p>

Bed rail so little one doesn’t fall off the bed – check! New favorite sheets – check! Nightlight, bedtime books, pillows and stuffed animals – check, check, check, check! All of these items will help make the transition smooth. </p>
							<p>And also once the bars of the crib are gone, you will need to ensure the entire space is safe, so be aware of what needs to be childproofed, perhaps some furniture or items should be secured or removed from the room entirely.</p>

								“I Love You”</h3>
							<p>Your heart will melt when your child says “mama” or “dada” for the first time. It feels so good that you can’t imagine how you will feel when your toddler actually says “I love you” or "wuv ooh", and then one day they just casually say it out of nowhere. Then later that day, they say it again. You just want to shout off the top of every rooftop, she loves us! She loves us! There’s no other feeling like it in the world. That’s your redemption for all the heartache, all the missed sleep, all the couple squabbles because of baby duty, all the times you sacrificed your personal time to do something sweet for your little one  - wrapped neatly into three little but unmistakeable words. As their vocabulary expands even further, they will no doubt, amaze you at every turn.</p>
