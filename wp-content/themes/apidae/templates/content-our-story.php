							<p>Even though parenting is a whole life job, childhood is fast and fleeting. As parents we cannot hold onto things forever but we can help in the creation of unforgettable memories that stay forever ripe in your child’s mind. After all, those little memories will follow them and guide them through each stage of life.</p>
							<p>Nobody ever said parenting is easy, it can be a tough gig at times – a learning curve of ever-changing schedules, wonder weeks and new milestones. And as a new parent you have so many decisions ahead of you, just navigating through all those essential baby products already feels overwhelming.</p>

							<p>So let us help to make those decisions easy – even wise proverbs teach us that it takes a village to raise a child – hence our name apidae – we are here to build a buzzing community that helps and shares. </p>
							<p><strong>We are three dads who are happy to openly share our own parenting experiences to make the natural selection of those essential purchasing decisions as effortless as possible. </strong></p>
							<p>How could three dads possibly impart such wisdom you may ask – We have been representing, creating and developing baby products for a decade and a half. Selling a huge range of quality baby products to other businesses in over 42 countries worldwide. Introducing products to other baby retailers has given us a wealth of experience in understanding all the practical facts and features. But there is just something about the process of becoming a parent – trying out products in real life with our own children has really opened our eyes to new and deep insights.</p>
